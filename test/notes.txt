env can be cloned in evaluateDefOrExpr or populateEnv

populateEnv or extendEnv can handle 

"dont override black holes cuz you made them in the same loop such as for stuff like (define (f x x) ...)"

if you make a call when multiple inputs have the same name thats an error
if someone defines x twice thats an error
